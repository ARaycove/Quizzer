We observe events occurring in a regular sequence, such as the sun rising every morning, and come to expect this regularity to continue in the future. This habitual expectation forms the basis of our belief in causality, as we mentally associate certain events with others due to their constant conjunction.

Like, a triangle is forever and always a different kind of thing than a square. A Mind is forever and always essentially different than a body.But Empiricists can be essentialists too. Carl Linnaeus, father of biological taxonomy, was a pretty firm essentialist. Now, his strict essentialism (some argue) cannot be empirically defended.That doesn\u2019t stop it from remaining the foundational metaphysical presumption in centuries ofempirical studies. (lol)But even a less strict, empiricist essentialism might hope that human categories (our every day divisions and groupings of the world around us) might express something true about reality. They might still \u201cCarve nature at its joints.\u201d (from Plato\u2019s Phaedrus, but a surviving aspiration of empiricism)",

Our belief in causality is based on the regularity of these observed conjunctions, leading to a habitual expectation of certain events following others. This habitual expectation forms the basis of inductive reasoning, where we infer that future events will resemble past events. However, this inference is not based on rational justification but on the assumption that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition that cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.",

This means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, we must presuppose that the future will resemble the past.

He suggests that our expectation that the future will resemble the past is not based on reason or evidence but on custom or habit. This means that our belief in the regularity of the world is not the result of rational inference but of a psychological tendency to expect things to continue as they have in the past.",

Suppose you think a particular book is in the library. You go to the shelf where you believe it was located and it is not there. Does the book exist in the library or not? One possibility is that you looked in the wrong place. You now look up its call number but you discover that the book is not at the location the call number speci\ufb01ed. There are now two possibilities: the book is somewhere in the library but you cannot \ufb01nd it, or the book has disappeared. For all intents and purposes, as long as you do not recover the book, you cannot know whether it exists. Saying it is there because there is a record that it possibly existed once (the call number) does not solve the problem, but begs the question.",

Digestion involves breaking down food into smaller molecules (like amino acids and sugars) that can be absorbed and utilized by the body.\n\nAnabolism, on the other hand, refers to the building up of complex molecules from simpler ones, which requires energy.

At the same time, anthropologists seek to understand the 'agency' of local people; in other words, the central role of individuals and groups in determining their own lives, even in the face of overwhelming structures of power\" (p. 13).

There is also evidence of a role in motivation, behavior, and a limbic-motor interface (Floresco, 2015; Salgado and Kaplitt, 2015). Another well-known role of the NAc is in addiction and reactivity to several psychoactive drugs. Because of these various functions, the NAc has been implicated in numerous other psychological disorders, such as addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and obesity (Salgado and Kaplitt, 2015). Its wide range of neural connections has led to an increase in research prevalence in recent years, particularly as a target for potential treatments of both physiological and psychological disorders. However, an important aspect of NAc functioning that is frequently overlooked is pain.",

        "answer_text": "The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in the processing and execution of motivated behaviors.\n\nAbstract: \"The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in the processing and execution of motivated behaviors. Yet this brain region is often overlooked in published discussions of the neurobiology of mental health (e.g., addiction, depression). This contributes to a gap in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. This review is presented to help bridge the gap by providing a resource for current knowledge of VP anatomy, projection patterns and subregional circuits, and how this organization relates to the function of VP neurons and ultimately behavior. For example, ventromedial (VPvm) and dorsolateral (VPdl) VP subregions receive projections from nucleus accumbens shell and core, respectively. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the VPvm project to mediodorsal thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area, and this VP subregion helps discriminate the appropriate conditions to acquire natural rewards or drugs of abuse, consume preferred foods, and perform working memory tasks. GABAergic neurons of the VPdl project to subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and this VP subregion is modulated by, and is necessary for, drug-seeking behavior. Additional circuits arise from nonGABAergic neuronal phenotypes that are likely to excite rather than inhibit their targets. These subregional and neuronal phenotypic circuits place the VP in a unique position to process motivationally-relevant stimuli and coherent adaptive behaviors.\"",
