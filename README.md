# What is this?

Quizzer is ready to use software
Quizzer contains a database of question(prompt) - answer pairs
Quizzer quizzes you on this information
Quizzer predicts when you'll forget that information and quiz you again so you never forget anything

Quizzer also includes a number of quality of life features
- Allow the user to set the average amount of questions per day they will answer
    - This allows you not to get overwhelmed by the volume of information you must review per day, simply set the average per day figure to an amount you can comfortably handle. Quizzer ensures this balance
- Under Settings you can set an interest value for every subject
    - Quizzes uses these values to determine the composition of the questions it will quiz you on. More interested in history, quizzer will prioritize history questions, more interested in biology, quizzer will focus more on whatever you are most interested in.
- Built in feed-back page
    - Don't like a feature, or want to see something else? Submit feedback from the menu, and Me and my team will do our best to make it a reality.
- Stats page
    - See real metrics tracking how much your learning every day, and other usage stats. This data also helps me optimize the underlying systems so it runs that much more efficient.
- Modules
    - Questions are broken down into modules so you can pick and choose currated modules based on what you're actively trying to learn at the moment. (WIP)

# Some quick future plans
- AI powered determination
    - A carefully trained AI model will be able to determine both the subject(s) and concept(s) for any given question-answer pair. This data can be used to better optimize what Quizzer shows you and in what order.
- Input Notes into Quizzer
    - Another AI algorithm planned is one where we can enter a textbook chapter, your notes, or any other scholarly information and get out a list of question-answer pairs to be entered into Quizzer's database for all User's to take advantage of.
    - However due to the inaccuracy of AI LLM models, it appears such an endeavour is still very much a work of fiction. We can't afford to input garbage information into the database.
- Mind-Maps
    - Mindmaps are a great way to study, and having a quick in-built tool serves two purposes
        - The mind map exercise helps the user understand gaps in their knowledge and tie related concepts together
        - The combined data of the entire user-bases mind maps would allow Quizzer to built a map of concepts based on the consensus of human minds. Thus leading to a system where concepts are introduced in intuitive and self-evident order, allowing for even quicker and easier learning.
- Essay-Prompts
    - Everyone hates essays, but writing them vastly improves understanding of given topics.
    - Once a master mind-map is constructed we can use that same map to generate intuitive essay prompts that users may practice their writing skills and challenge their thinking.
    - These essays once submitted can further fuel the robustness of the system.

Data-Collection is scary, So we take care to safeguard and ensure its safety.

Democratize Learning for everyone, not just those who can afford quality schooling.
