- It should be noted that the system puts questions into circulation dynamically. That is once the user has exhausted all available questions to be reviewed, Quizzer will then begin to add in new questions into the user's circulating feed of questions.
    - This remains dynamic because as the user gets new questions the average amount being asked every day will go up. So at some point the user will not answer all of the questions to be reviewed that day. Causing the average to drop.
    - This also has the byproduct of balancing for cognitive load.
    - While cognitive load is not tracked, the user will only answer so many questions based on how much mental capacity they have that day. Meaning if more demanding questions are added, the result is a decrease in the total number of questions answered. If the questions are less demanding and are recalled quicker, the result is more questions answered. Thus the problem of cognitive load is handled without a need for tracking it.
