## Introduction
Here in western society, from the time we are young until the time we become of legal age, education is our core responsibility. Yet when we graduate high school, education becomes an option rather than a mandatory staple of our lives. Is this a failure of superiors? Or the extension of the value of freedom? If education is of the highest virtue, why is it abandoned when we come of age? The concerns to be explored extend from the belief that education is not actually a real priority in our society. For if education was as valued as it would appear, we would be encouraged on a societal level to continue our education into our adulthood and place lifelong learning as a key priority. Much research and much debate already exists in academia, coming from many different viewpoints. It could be said that the onus of educating oneself should not be upon the individual, for that poses great danger to society at large, rather the onus of educating a people should be upon those guardians who have set themselves as shepherds of the people, yet this also can be said to be dangerous. To engage in such a pursuit, we can echo the words of Immanuel Kant's "What is Enlightenment". Namely that these guardians are not a good thing, that we should be given the intellectual freedom to pursue enlightenment, the use of our own understanding. Yet we come upon a grave issue, if people are given this freedom, then so far restricted in their civil and economic liberties that exercising such freedom becomes implausible then we have failed the very notion that people should think and learn for themselves. So the goal instead becomes how do we model a system that not only gives people the freedom and tools to learn but also extends the imperative of learning beyond high school and into adulthood.

To properly answer such a monumental issue, I must first break down the methodology in part. We will not be exploring value systems or the hows and whys behind societal change. While we could explore how economic systems restrict people while leaving a "freedom of indifference" intact, or we could explore how systems of government impact our education, such topics deserve a discussion unto themselves. Instead, my concern tends itself towards the physical nature of the mind, what factors help or hinder the learning process, and how such processes of the brain can be mathematically modeled so we might be able to act upon them with the same scientific rigor that took us to the Moon and later to Mars. With this we can build the tools necessary to enable us to effectively pursue education not only in our youth, but well into our adulthood and into our senior years.

A few targeted questions can help us create a theory of learning that can be acted upon in a systematic way by future institutions. How do ideas relate to each other? How do we learn things, and how can we foster long-term retention of that information? What determines whether a question fosters better understanding or is only good for assessment? Given an idea, what determines what is required to understand that idea? How do we model and map the answers to develop a form a grand unified theory of human learning in order to create a streamlined education process?

Before we continue it is important to clarify the scope a little further, that is the concern that nuance of human condition might in some way invalidate all research. In public discourse there are those who argue that exceptions to learning patterns invalidate broader research findings - similar to how one might claim a single rotten apple spoils the entire barrel. We could dismiss this as a logical or rhetorical fallacy, but it would be better to answer such exceptions as to make the arguments more sound. Specifically that is neurological disorders and children. "we should not seek to regard children's learning, for example, as necessarily different from adult learning - even though there may be different processes and it occurs in different social contexts." (Peter Jarvis, 2005). Further we could conclude by extension that the learning of neurodivergent individuals are not necessarily different than neurotypical individuals. While processes differ from person to person, the underlying fundamentals are the same. With this assurance we build a bedrock for implementing learning techniques knowing that they are applicable across all human life.

This stance challenges conventional educational paradigms that artificially segment learning approaches by age or neurological profile. Current systems operate under the implicit assumption that children and adults, or neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals, require fundamentally different educational methodologies rather than adaptations of the same core approaches. Consider how play-based learning is often relegated to special education or early childhood settings, despite its demonstrated effectiveness across all learning contexts, including adults. Similarly, our educational systems arbitrarily withhold both simple and complex philosophical concepts, grave issues such as historical atrocities, and nuanced ethical discussions from younger learners, as if humans suddenly develop the capacity to process such material at some predetermined age. This segmentation reflects institutional convenience rather than cognitive reality. A truly effective educational model would recognize that the fundamental processes of human learning remain consistent across the lifespan and across neurological variations while acknowledging that the scaffolding, pacing, and presentation may require thoughtful adjustment. This perspective necessitates not merely incremental improvement but a comprehensive redesign of our educational frameworks to align with how humans actually learn rather than how institutions find it convenient to teach.
