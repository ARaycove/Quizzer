# User Device (Client)
## Frontend UI
Primary Coding Language: Dart with Flutter
## Algorithms
Primary Coding Language: Dart
These algorithms will be written locally and packed with the application:
- Memory Retention Algorithm
- Question Selection Algorithm
- Data Synchronization Algorithm
## Local Database
Essential data stored locally and written with SQLlite which comes packed alongside Dart. Any data the user client might need will be synced and stored locally. Since it is expected that the overall size and scale of the data Quizzer will store will grow beyond what is feasible for the average user's device, only what is required for usage of the application will be stored locally, the rest will get synced with the central database

# Server Side Operations

# Database


# Frontend UI
Written in Dart with Flutter

# Application Logic
Written in Dart. Core algorithms and data collection logic is also packaged with the Frontend codebase

# Database

# Data processing
Once data is collected and synced with a central DB, backend code on the server will be written in Python. This will include all processing for the machine learning algorithms, and the compute power necessary to train such algorithms will be divorced from the user clients

# Compute Heavy Tasks
If any task does become too compute heavy it will need to be moved to the server, where more powerful resources can be employed
