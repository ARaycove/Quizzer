## Building a model
The Quizzer platform represents a multifaceted approach to optimizing human learning through computational methods and cognitive science principles. This section outlines the integrated components that form our comprehensive learning model. Beginning with question-answer pairs as the fundamental unit of knowledge retrieval, we explore how these elements can be systematically managed within a digital environment to enhance retention. We then examine the scientific methodology underpinning our approach, emphasizing large-scale data collection through structured behavioral tasks. The model addresses information quality through rigorous verification processes, knowledge representation through graph-based structures, and personalization through user interest assessment. These elements are balanced within a cognitive load framework that seeks to prevent overwhelm while maximizing efficiency. Finally, we explore how artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies enable automation of these processes at scale, transforming raw academic content into personalized learning sequences. Together, these components create a system that adapts to individual learning patterns while maintaining scientific validity.

Every interaction with another human being, where the goal is to gain information or exchange information, usually involves some form of question. Questions have become our primary means of gathering information, without them learning breaks down. Without a question you are never prompted to retrieve information, and when information is not retrieved and utilized your brain is designed to forget it. The proposed generalized solution is to place all information you wish to retain indefinitely into a system that will manage when you should review any given piece of information to ensure you never forget it. This is obviously an extremely broad proposal, so it needs to be broken down into granular chunks so that we might actually be able to build such a thing.

The foundation of this project is a commitment to established scientific methodology. Rather than relying solely on traditional experimental designs with control groups, we employ a data-driven approach using large-scale behavioral tasks to gather diverse, high-volume datasets. These tasks—including source material acquisition, question generation, key term identification, and knowledge assessment—create a comprehensive data ecosystem that enables pattern discovery and model refinement. As outlined in our methods section, this approach aligns with emerging paradigms in educational data mining (Baker & Siemens, 2014) where broad data collection precedes focused analysis. By making the software freely available, we can collect usage data from a diverse, global user base, addressing potential sampling biases. This expansive dataset will allow us to identify which elements of the system effectively enhance learning across different demographics and knowledge domains, creating an empirical foundation for ongoing refinement of the Quizzer platform.

A major issue to address is the quality of the information entered, "garbage in, garbage out" is a common cliche that holds quite well. If the information inputted into the system is not academically verifiable it risks becoming misinformation or even disinformation. So while gathering an academic database of source material is a long and arduous process, it becomes a vital component of a sound educational system. We could then conclude that simply setting up a simple spaced repetition schedule for learning is not sufficient in and of itself. We need to input high quality questions into our learning process in addition to properly spacing them. To resolve the problem of ensuring a vast academic database of vetted and verifiable information, the proposal is a simple behavioral task that involves reading academic material and parsing it into numerous passages from which question-answer pairs can be derived. This data would then be stored in a simple table where the citation is provided alongside the passage or other content. This task is further described in the "breakdown of behavioral tasks" section of this paper.

A critical element of this model is the representation of knowledge as an interconnected graph structure. By mapping relationships between concepts, we create a formal knowledge graph where nodes represent individual facts or concepts and edges represent the semantic relationships between them. This graph-based approach allows us to analyze not just isolated facts but the complex network of connections that make knowledge coherent and memorable. Using established graph theory algorithms, we can identify concept clusters, prerequisite relationships, and optimal learning pathways through the knowledge space. When combined with user interaction data, this knowledge graph enables us to predict which concepts would be most efficiently learned next based on a user's existing knowledge structure—respecting cognitive load constraints while maximizing learning efficiency. The system can then generate personalized learning sequences that adapt to each user's unique knowledge state and learning patterns, presenting new information at the optimal moment when it can be most effectively integrated into their existing knowledge network.

Next, we need to evaluate the user themselves. It is not enough to simply write good questions and space them effectively. Metaphysically we are all human, and the same basic cognitive processes guide us all, however there is a difference in degree and performance between humans. There is a also vast array of interests and talents in which individuals categorize themselves. What interests one person, can be repulsive to another. So such a system needs to account for the individuals capacity for learning, and their individual interests and talents. For this we need a framework in which to record what an interest actually is and what knowledge is. Here I define knowledge as a independent verifiable factual statements that interconnect with other independent verifiable factual statements. Knowledge therefore does not exist in a vacuum and the relationship between units of knowledge needs to be understood.

"Cognitive Load Theory describes memory as having three main parts: sensory, working, and long-term. Cognitive load is divided up into three types, intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Cognitive overload occurs when the combination of intrinsic, extraneous and germane loads becomes overwhelming for the learner." (mcw.edu) Scientists have found a way to effectively measure cognitive load as well. This part of the model is designed around this theory, that we should only present as much information as the user is capable of. This solution effectively solves burnout while maintaining long-term performance. We do not need to push ourselves over the edge in order to be highly effective learners. The general design would be to track cognitive load throughout the usage of the software, and provide the user with visual feedback of what Quizzer thinks is their current cognitive load and allow the system to recommend that the user either quit for the day, or take a break. Linking useful strategies the user could take if they wish to read and learn more about how human learning actually works and can be optimized.

The cornerstone of Quizzer's effectiveness lies in its memory retention algorithm, which mathematically models the probability of information loss over time. Building upon Ebbinghaus's pioneering work on the forgetting curve—notably confirmed by Murre and Dros (2015)—this algorithm constructs an individualized temporal model that predicts when specific knowledge approaches the threshold of forgetting. The system maps retention probability (P) against time (t) using a modified exponential decay function that incorporates multiple variables including previous exposure frequency, response confidence, response time, and concept inter-connectivity within the knowledge graph. This creates a multidimensional model where P = f(t, r, c, i, s), where r represents repetition history, c represents confidence metrics, i represents inter-connectivity with existing knowledge, and s represents subject-specific retention characteristics derived from aggregated user data. By setting a target retention probability threshold (typically 85-90%), the system identifies the precise moment for review that maximizes the spacing effect while preventing forgetting—the theoretical sweet spot that strengthens neural pathways through optimal challenge. This approach significantly reduces necessary review time by presenting material precisely when cognitive science suggests it will have maximum retention benefit, allowing users to maintain substantially larger knowledge bases with minimal time investment compared to fixed-interval review systems.

Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence gives us the capability to process human language as input into a computer program. The origins of Natural Language Processing (NLP) come from the 1940's with the term Artificial Intelligence first being coined in the early 1950's with Alan Turing's "the Imitation game". As of 2024, AI has reached a point that allows us to easily process billions of pages of text. Using this technology allows us to automate the next part of human learning, generating quality questions which enhance the encoding process of memory and the subsequent retrieval of our memory.  It my hope that effectively designing AI, Machine Learning, and NLP to read text and notes; questions may be generated which better challenge the user's understanding of the material rather than manually entered by either a staff of people or by research participants. Most of our time spent reading academic text is to gather information in addition to learning and retaining that information. Since it's already known that AI can read and gather information much faster than humans, we can use AI to do the heavy lifting of gathering information from dense academic literature. With such a tool in place we would be able to focus our effort on learning the material instead of compiling already compiled information into notebooks and documents.

Collectively, these components form an integrated system designed to address the fundamental challenges of human learning and memory retention. By combining question-answer retrieval practice, scientifically-validated spacing algorithms, knowledge graph representation, personalized interest mapping, cognitive load management, and AI-powered content generation and classification, Quizzer represents a comprehensive approach to lifelong learning that extends beyond traditional educational paradigms. This model bridges theoretical cognitive science with practical implementation through data-driven refinement, creating a dynamic system that evolves with user interaction patterns. The modular architecture allows for continuous improvement as new research emerges and as our user data reveals unexpected patterns in learning behavior. Rather than merely providing another digital flashcard system, Quizzer aims to fundamentally transform how knowledge acquisition and retention are approached, potentially enabling individuals to maintain vast repositories of knowledge with minimal review time. As the platform develops, this theoretical model will be refined through empirical validation, ensuring that the practical implementation aligns with the scientific principles upon which it is built.
