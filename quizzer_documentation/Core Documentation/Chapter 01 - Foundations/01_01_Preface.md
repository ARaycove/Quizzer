# Preface
Throughout history, humanity has progressively mastered technology, transforming our world from tribal societies to agrarian societies to industrial powerhouses. Today, we have the privilege of leveraging computational power to implement scientific knowledge in ways previously unimaginable. This technological revolution allows everyday people to effortlessly apply complex scientific principles to enhance their quality of life. We truly stand upon the shoulders of giants – the men and women whose pioneering work forms our foundation. This project seeks to honor their contributions, faithfully and charitably interpret their insights, and seeks to realize the aspirations they set forth. In doing such we can carry the torch and pass on the long legacy that is humankind.

The field of learning science has been shaped by numerous visionaries. Hermann Ebbinghaus's groundbreaking work on memory (1880-1885) established the "Forgetting Curve," which was remarkably confirmed with identical results in 2015 by Jaap M.J. Murre and Joeri Dros. Further mathematical foundations were developed by Gustav Levine and C.J. Burke in their seminal work "Mathematical Model Techniques for Learning Theories," enabling us to quantify and model human learning processes with unprecedented precision.

Perhaps no contemporary scholar has contributed more to understanding adult learning than Peter Jarvis, the renowned educator and emeritus professor of continuing education at the University of Surrey who passed away at age 81. In his book "Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Human Learning," Jarvis wrote: "I have written it in the profound hope that it might help others who want to know a little more about teaching and learning: this includes students and teachers, course designers and educational managers, and also policy makers. All that I can hope is that in some ways it may prove useful to those who do me the honour of reading my work." It is my honor to continue his work, to advance his legacy, and to hopefully one day pass these insights forward. Though Peter is no longer with us, his contributions, and the contributions of the numerous unmentioned others, to the field enable the work we now undertake with Quizzer – a system that applies these theoretical foundations to create practical tools for enhanced learning.
