# Methods
The Quizzer project employs a data-driven exploratory methodology prioritizing breadth and volume of data collection over traditional experimental controls. This approach aligns with emerging research paradigms in educational technology and machine learning where pattern discovery precedes hypothesis testing (Baker & Siemens, 2014). 

# Data Collection Framework
Data collection is structured through sequential, modular behavioral tasks designed to build a comprehensive dataset for machine learning analysis. In addition to fine-tuned behavioral tasks, we also are able to pull additional datasets that can be adapted. One such method is through data-sets from huggingface.io that are ready for this application:

1. Source Material Acquisition: Participants extract passages from academic texts and record proper citations, creating a foundation of verified educational content. This provides the secondary benefit of being able to legal copyright issues, if copyright issues are raised, those sources and associated content can be pulled until the matter is handled. Additionally this allows the Quizzer team to prove that material was not copyrighted from a non-approved source. Initial Source Material will be derived from open-source texts such as openstax and other such platforms that offer open-source access to educational content.
2. Question Generation: For each source passage, participants generate multiple possible question formulations based on the source passage. Questions generated should not rely on having just read the source passage for context, phrasing such as according to the passage, or according to the text without any such quotation in the question itself is not acceptable for this task. This ensures focus on understanding of established knowledge rather than niche authority.
3. Answer Generation: Participants provide corresponding answers to previously generated questions, completing question-answer pairs that serve as the fundamental unit of analysis.
4. Key Term Identification: Participants extract relevant concepts and terminology from passages, generating a semantic network of interconnected knowledge elements. Data from this behaviorial task will be used to assess whether or not certain key words or terminology apply to a given question-answer pair
5. Subject and Concept Classification: Participants rate the relevance of question-answer pairs to subjects and concepts on a granular scale (-1 to 1), enabling multidimensional classification beyond binary categorization.
6. Knowledge Assessment: Users respond to question-answer pairs with confidence ratings, response times, and other metadata that captures the temporal dimension of knowledge retention.

# Methodological Justification
This research diverges from traditional experimental designs with control and experimental groups, instead leveraging large-scale data collection where natural patterns and groupings emerge organically. This approach is justified by:
- The inherently multivariate nature of memory retention across diverse knowledge domains
- The need to capture cross-disciplinary connections that might be obscured by artificially constrained experimental boundaries
- The ability of machine learning algorithms to identify significant patterns and relationships in large, unstructured datasets

As noted by Siemens and Long (2011), educational data mining often begins with broad data collection before narrowing to specific intervention testing. The structure of our database schema (see Tables documentation) allows for post-hoc analysis of naturally occurring groups based on subject interest, response patterns, or temporal characteristics.
This approach aligns with Baker's (2014) model of educational data mining where discovery with data precedes confirmation through targeted analysis.
