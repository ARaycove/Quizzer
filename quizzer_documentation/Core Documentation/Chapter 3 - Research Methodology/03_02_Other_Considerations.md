### What about existing datasets?
The Quizzer platform's behavioral tasks have been deliberately designed with granularity as a primary architectural principle, facilitating seamless integration with pre-existing research datasets. This granular approach yields structured data that requires minimal preprocessing, enabling direct table joins during analytical operations without extensive data cleaning procedures. The field of educational technology and cognitive science offers numerous established datasets containing question-answer pairs and learning interaction data. Repositories such as Huggingface and Open-Neuro provide valuable resources that can be incorporated into Quizzer's analytical framework. For instance, these datasets could enhance validation algorithms that assess the quality of generated question-answer pairs or support unsupervised learning approaches where complementary models train iteratively against each otherâ€”the validation model providing feedback to refine the primary model. By maintaining consistent data structures and standardized classification systems across all behavioral tasks, the Quizzer platform maximizes interoperability with external research datasets, positioning the collected behavioral data as one component within a broader analytical ecosystem rather than an isolated repository
