Every good scientific inquiry starts with a line of questions to guide that research.


# Given any piece of information, or any question, what is the probability you will answer that question correctly if asked right now?
**Short Answer**: probability, we capture real user interaction data with questions using an existing formula, recording the results. We then take that set of data and run a linear regression model to fit the data, and that will spit out the formula for what the probability of correctness is based on our parameters.

# What parameters will be required to calculate the probability of correctness, most accurately
See [[Neural-Net Layer]] Diagram for outline of the input layer to our probability model

**Sleep meta-data**: Current research highly suggests that sleep quality and duration are highly correlated to cognitive performance for this reason we will include some basic meta-data for sleep metrics. Set of sleep data can be gotten by physical devices, to collect this and have it be good for the model, we need users who willingly sync their health data with us, which is recorded by other applications.

**Module Performance Data** (16 features)
To be meaningful to the model, all module vectors will be ordered alphabetically by name, to ensure that all module vectors combined result in uniform ordering.

We will label every such feature set as ```{module_name}_feature_name```

Does the number of questions by type effect accuracy?
Do individual question types effect accuracy?
Does partial versus full exposure to a module introduce transfer learning benefits?

## Some other Questions
Does the amount of time a user is awake for, effect their accuracy?


# Given a large dataset of questions and their answers, how do we efficiently group them and link them together in order to capture, numerically, the relationship between them
