Every good scientific inquiry starts with a line of questions to guide that research.


# Given any piece of information, or any question, what is the probability you will answer that question correctly if asked right now?
**Short Answer**: probability, we capture real user interaction data with questions using an existing formula, recording the results. We then take that set of data and run a linear regression model to fit the data, and that will spit out the formula for what the probability of correctness is based on our parameters.

# What parameters will be required to calculate the probability of correctness, most accurately
See [[Neural-Net Layer]] Diagram for outline of the input layer to our probability model

**Sleep meta-data**: Current research highly suggests that sleep quality and duration are highly correlated to cognitive performance for this reason we will include some basic meta-data for sleep metrics
