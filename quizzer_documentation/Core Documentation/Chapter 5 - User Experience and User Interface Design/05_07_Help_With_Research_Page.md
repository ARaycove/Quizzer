# Help with Research Page
## Purpose
The main interface conducts the primary behavioral task behind Quizzer, answering question answer pairs and recording the results helps to gather data for training a ML model that can predict the probability of memory loss. There are other tasks that must be conducted, however these tasks are not of immediate benefit to our user's. The Help with Research page introduces users to Quizzer's behavioral tasks, explains their scientific purpose, and guides users to contribute meaningfully to the research project. We believe that properly describing the purpose and reason behind these additional tasks, and how they might serve as supplementary education will result in some percentage of the user base reliably completing these tasks.
