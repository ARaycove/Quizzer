Very briefly, this feature would allow the user to toggle whether or not the presented question-answer pairs must be answered within a specific time-frame. Having this feature in place would enforce speed of recall as well as accuracy of recall. It is understood that reaction times are not causal to accuracy, but it is very nice to be able to recall information quickly as well as accurately. This would be toggle-able feature, rather than a standard since not all user's may want this added difficulty, even it can be useful for learning.
