# Module System

## Overview
The Module System provides a structured approach for organizing and managing groups of question-answer pairs within the Quizzer platform. Unlike the algorithmic approach of the core system, modules allow for manual curation and activation of specific knowledge domains, giving users greater control over their learning experience.

## Purpose
The Module System serves multiple essential functions within the Quizzer ecosystem:
1. **Semantic Grouping**: Allows related question-answer pairs to be grouped by meaningful relationships beyond simple subject classification
2. **User Control**: Provides users direct control over which knowledge domains they engage with
3. **Learning Pathway Management**: Enables structured learning sequences that can be toggled on/off as needed
4. **Content Organization**: Creates a higher-level organizational layer above individual question-answer pairs
5. **Curriculum Support**: Facilitates alignment with formal educational curricula or learning objectives

## Technical Implementation
Every Question Answer Pair will only belong to a single module

Each module is represented as a distinct data structure with the following attributes:

| Attribute        | Data Type    | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| module_name      | String       | User-friendly name for the module                                         |
| description      | String       | Brief explanation of the module's content and purpose                     |
| primary_subject  | String       | The dominant subject classification represented in this module            |
| subjects         | String(CSV)  | Complete list of all unique subjects covered by questions in this module  |
| related_concepts | String(CSV)  | Complete list of all unique concepts/key terms represented in this module |
| question_ids     | String(CSV)  | Array of all question_ids belonging to this module                        |
| creation_date    | date_time    | When the module was created                                               |
| creator_id       | String(uuid) | User who created the module                                               |
| last_modified    | date_time    | When the module was last updated                                          |
| total_questions  | int          | The number of questions in the module                                     |
There will also be a is_active boolean relating is modules inside the user_profile
## Functional Behavior
When a user activates a module through the interface:
1. All questions belonging to that module become eligible for circulation through the Question_Circulation algorithm
2. The `is_active` flag for the module is set to true
3. Questions that exist in active modules adhere to the standard interest-based selection criteria when being added by the Question_Circulation algorithm
4. The Question_Circulation algorithm prioritizes module-based questions when adding new content to circulation

When a user deactivates a module:
1. All questions belonging exclusively to that module will get removed from circulation, questions not yet in circulation become ineligible to be placed into circulation
2. The `is_active` flag for the module is set to false inside the user's profile

## Module Relationships to Questions
A single question-answer pair can only belong to a single module:
- Each question maintains an array of module_ids it belongs to
- When calculating module metadata (subjects, concepts), the system performs a unique aggregation across all member questions
- The primary_subject is determined by frequency analysis of all subject classifications across member questions

## User Interface Integration
The Module System is exposed to users through the dedicated "Display Modules Page" detailed in [[05_15_Display_Modules_Page]]. This interface allows users to:
- Browse available modules with descriptive metadata
- Toggle modules on/off to control learning focus
- View statistical information about module completion status
- Explore relationships between modules and their content domains

## Creation and Management
Modules can be created through multiple pathways:
1. **User-Generated**: Users can manually create modules when generating question-answer pairs
2. **System-Generated**: The platform can automatically suggest modules based on pattern recognition in user learning data
3. **Imported**: Pre-built modules can be shared between users or distributed by content creators
4. **Curriculum-Aligned**: Educational institutions can create modules that align with specific courses or learning objectives

## Technical Dependencies
The Module System integrates with several core components of the Quizzer architecture:
- **Question_Circulation Algorithm**: Module activation status directly impacts question eligibility for circulation
- **Database Schema**: Requires additional tables to track module definitions and question-module relationships
- **User Interface**: Dedicated module management interfaces as described in UI/UX documentation
- **Analytics Framework**: Provides additional dimensions for analyzing learning performance by module

## Future Development
Potential enhancements to the Module System include:
1. **Module Dependencies**: Establishing prerequisite relationships between modules
2. **Learning Paths**: Creating sequences of modules that build upon each other
3. **Completion Metrics**: Adding progress tracking and completion recognition
4. **Collaborative Modules**: Enabling team-based learning through shared modules
5. **Adaptive Modules**: Developing modules that dynamically adjust based on performance
