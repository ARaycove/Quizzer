# Main Interface 
Upon logging in the user should get sent directly into the main interface of the program. This interface will be the core Answer Questions behavioral task. The user will be presented with a question, the center of the screen should be one large button, when clicked the interface should show an extremely fast animation, then the answer to that question should appear. At the bottom of the page will be 5 buttons (Yes(sure), Yes(unsure), (?), No(sure), No(unsure)) to reflect the options in the Answer Questions behavioral task. Clicking the center button should bring up three additional options to select. (Did not Read Question Properly), (Not Interested In This), (Too Advanced for Me)
