# Menu Interface
The menu will contain links to individual behavioral task interfaces, to the settings page, and to any other pages listed. The menu interface is merely the navigation element of quizzer
## Buttons
The buttons in the menu only redirect, so every button here will just serve to change the page the user is on.

### Add Question Interface
-> Directs the user to the Add Question page
Adding Questions and Adding answers to questions are separate tasks, or can be separate tasks.

I am contemplating two options. 
1. Separate the tasks entirely requiring the full chain (add content, then questions, then answers)
2. Adopt the original, and have an add question page that lets you enter just a question and answer pair, without reference to content.

The thought process is that once staff is hired the tasks can then be broken down more granularly so staff can conduct these exercises in an assembly line fashion. However for regular users the option to add a full question-answer pair directly should remain.

So my thought is now that we should have a 4 total interfaces surrounding this task. One that allows full entry of a question answer pair, one interface that allows entry of individual content snippets from source material, one (specialized) interface that scans entered content and finds content that does not have question-answer pairs associated with it, and a final interface that scans for question-answer pairs that are missing the answer segment of the pair and has the user enter just the answer for that pair, while also displaying the source material that's tied to it.
