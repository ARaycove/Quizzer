Quizzer is designed to be fully functional even without an internet connection. Today it's very easy to use cloud services to quickly write and deploy an application. Everything can quickly connect to the cloud, and the process quickly becomes like piecing Lego's together. However the problem comes when more advanced or customized features need to be implemented. For this reason Quizzer will avoid relying upon 3rd party services and cloud architecture if at all possible. This decision also comes out of need to avoid predatory pricing that often accompanies such SaaS conveniences. They tend to lure a person or organization in with free tier pricing, then once things get busy the prices go up drastically and because the application was built around this service it becomes difficult or even impossible to then switch providers. So again for these reasons, if a system can be written and developed locally it shall be done locally and from "scratch". While this may extend the development time, we believe this method will reduce complexity in the long run, increase maintainability, and reduce costs, paying massive dividends well into the future.
