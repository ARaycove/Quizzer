### Open-Source Commitment
The Quizzer platform adheres to open-source principles in both its code architecture and data collection methodology. All behavioral task data collected through the platform will be published online under appropriate user agreements to ensure ethical usage while maximizing research accessibility. It is important to emphasize that Quizzer is fundamentally a research project designed to investigate the mechanisms of memory retention and optimize human learning processes. As such, the platform and its associated datasets are intended for non-commercial applications, with explicit prohibitions against monetization or for-profit redistribution. This commitment to open-source values aligns with broader scientific goals of transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative advancement of educational technology.
