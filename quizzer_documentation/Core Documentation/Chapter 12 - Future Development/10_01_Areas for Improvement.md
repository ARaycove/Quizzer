General feedback that has been expressed, but not investigated

1. **Task Complexity and Participant Burden**
    - The tasks require significant cognitive effort from participants, potentially leading to fatigue and reduced data quality
    - Consider breaking tasks into smaller micro-tasks to improve participant engagement and data reliability
2. **Quality Control Mechanisms**
    - While review processes are mentioned, more explicit criteria for accepting/rejecting contributions would strengthen quality control
    - Consider implementing an inter-rater reliability system for validations
3. **Balance Between Structure and Flexibility**
    - The current task design is highly structured, which aids in data consistency but might limit natural learning patterns
    - Consider adding some free-form learning activities to capture more naturalistic behaviors
4. **Technical Implementation Details**
    - The task descriptions sometimes blur implementation details with conceptual design
    - Consider separating the behavioral task descriptions from technical implementation specifics
5. **User Motivation and Engagement**
    - The document focuses heavily on data collection but less on what motivates users to participate
    - Consider incorporating gamification elements or learning benefits to sustain engagement

- Don't code, write all documentation in 100% completion before writing a single line of code
