fix the building of the revision_streak_stats, so it sorts the dictionaries keys in numerical order
- pulled raw data, changed data type to a list, manually rebuilt the data, by inserting items in the desired order
- create a sources property to question objects, here will be information on where the answer came from. Academic sources
    - All question objection now have academic_sources key value pair where the value is a list. Intended use is to insert individual citations into the list.
