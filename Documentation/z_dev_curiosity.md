It starts with a z so the file goes to the bottom when sorted

- This is my musing, if you don't want to read random thoughts, don't proceed.


Ok as I'm answering the questions, I am coming up with more questions, curiosity. At least for me the randomness of the question presentation is prompting my curiosity. So I'm making this document to record my random questions for later lookup. So the most recent example asked when Jacques Necker got appointer Minister of Geneva? To which my answer is 1768, along with a nagging question, What is the role of the Minister of Geneva? When did that become a thing? I get a lot more questions like this, my brain trying to get a more robust picture of what's going on. So with that said below is a list of these random questions I have so I can guide my future studies.

I'm also using this file to enter answers for my questions, well the ones asked by my Quizzer. I think I'll keep calling it "my" Quizzer, it'll give a sense of ownership, afterall it's supposed to be a personalized experience








This is essentially my horizon of ignorance
- So I'm testing a new study strategy, which can be summed as
- Spend time answering questions (while answering record any questions you have)
- Spend the next part of the study session looking up your answers to your questions you've had, removing them from your active record
    - This study session will seek documentation from textbooks or other academic source material and dig into not only that question but surrounding context, filling in many questions, allowing my natural mechanism of curiosity to guide what should be looked up next
