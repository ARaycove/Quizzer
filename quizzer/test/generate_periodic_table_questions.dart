// Very large amount of potential questions here
// Need a List of maps, where each map is the information relating to each element
// {element_number: n, element_type: "type", etc for each metric around that element}


// Questions
// 1 question for every element, asking what type it is where options are all available types
// fill_in_the_blank questions for every element 
// - give number expect element
// - give element expect number


// 2 sort_order questions (100 total questions)
// This serves as our test set of questions to ensure that the sort_order widget works
// - give random group of 5 element names, sort by element number
