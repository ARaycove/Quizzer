# Session Manager

## Overview
The Session Manager serves as the primary internal API layer between the UI and all backend subsystems. It provides a unified interface for all UI-backend communication, ensuring clean separation between presentation and business logic.

## Purpose
- Acts as the single point of access for all UI-backend communication
- Maintains application state and session data
- Routes UI requests to appropriate backend subsystems
- Manages access control and permissions
- Provides a consistent interface for all backend operations

## Architecture
### Core Components
1. **State Management**
   - Maintains global application state
   - Tracks user session data
   - Manages page navigation history

2. **Communication Layer**
   - Routes UI requests to appropriate subsystems
   - Handles cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling)
   - Provides clean interfaces for all backend operations

3. **Access Control**
   - Manages permissions and access to backend services
   - Ensures secure communication between UI and backend
   - Validates requests before routing to subsystems

## Integration Points
### UI Integration
- All UI components should interact with backend systems through the Session Manager
- Direct UI-to-backend communication should be avoided
- UI components should only contain presentation logic

### Backend Integration
- Each backend subsystem should be accessed through Session Manager methods
- Subsystems should not be directly exposed to the UI
- All cross-cutting concerns should be handled at this layer

## Usage Guidelines
1. **For UI Developers**
   - Always use Session Manager methods to interact with backend systems
   - Do not create direct connections to backend subsystems
   - Handle UI-specific logic in UI components only

2. **For Backend Developers**
   - Expose new functionality through Session Manager methods
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging
   - Maintain clean interfaces for UI consumption

## Future Development
1. **Planned Improvements**
   - Consolidate all UI-backend communication through this layer
   - Enhance access control and permission management
   - Implement comprehensive logging and error handling
   - Create unified interfaces for all backend operations

2. **Refactoring Goals**
   - Move existing direct UI-backend communications to this layer
   - Standardize all backend access patterns
   - Improve testing and debugging capabilities

## Example Usage
```dart
// UI Component
final sessionManager = SessionManager();
final result = await sessionManager.getNextQuestion();

// Instead of
final question = await getNextQuestion(); // Direct backend access
```

## Notes
- This component is critical for maintaining clean architecture
- All new features should follow the pattern of UI -> Session Manager -> Backend
- Existing direct connections will be refactored over time
