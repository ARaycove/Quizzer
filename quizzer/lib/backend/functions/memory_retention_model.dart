// Algorithm would take the attempt data
// For every record we would calculate the probability for that record (I'm told there is a way to accomplish this)

// We can derive a model that takes a target probability (θ%) and figure at what point in time that the probability of a correct answer for a given question-answer pair is θ - I'm assuming this would be the inverse function, but it's multi-dimensional so I'm a bit confused

// The placeholder is ebbinghauses formula for memory retention, but the update will be an active learning model for predicting retention over time
