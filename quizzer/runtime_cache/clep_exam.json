The art form cubism, which emphasizes the fragmentation of modern life, can be seen as promoting relativistic thought, as can existentialism, which promoted the idea that each person needs to create his or her own meaning in life. Deism argues that God is not involved in people's day-to-day affairs, and absolutism refers to the theoretically complete power-some monarchs—such as France's Louis XIV—held in the seventeenth century."
